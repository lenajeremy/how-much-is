Okay, here are actionable steps an LLM could follow to conceptually build the "Market Price Watch" service based on the PRD (market_price_watch_prd_v1):

Phase 1: Setup & Backend Foundation

Initialize Project:

Set up the project directory structure (e.g., separate client and server folders).
Choose backend technology stack (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Flask/Django).
Initialize version control using Git (git init).
Set up basic environment configuration (e.g., .env file for database credentials, ports).
Database Modeling & Setup:

Design the database schema based on PRD Section 5.3 (REQ-09, REQ-10) and Section 7 (PostgreSQL/PostGIS recommended). Define tables: Items, Units, Markets, PriceReports, States, Cities. Specify relationships and data types.
Write SQL scripts or use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) migration tool to create these tables in a PostgreSQL database.
Enable the PostGIS extension if using PostgreSQL for geospatial capabilities.
Populate Initial Data:

Research and create seed data/scripts to populate the Items, Units, States, and Cities tables based on REQ-09 and REQ-10. This requires defining the initial list of ~20-40 common Nigerian food items and their standard units.
Develop Core API - Submission:

Create the backend API endpoint POST /api/prices (REQ-02).
Implement server-side input validation logic (REQ-03).
Write the logic to insert validated price report data into the PriceReports table, linking to relevant Items, Units, Markets (potentially creating new market entries if needed, or using a defined handling strategy per Open Issue #2).
Ensure the submission timestamp is automatically recorded (REQ-04).
Develop Core API - Retrieval & Aggregation:

Create the GET /api/items endpoint to serve the list of items and their valid units to the frontend.
Create the GET /api/locations endpoint to serve States and Cities.
Create the GET /api/prices endpoint (REQ-06) with filtering capabilities (by item, state, city). Implement database queries to fetch and return price reports.
Create the GET /api/mapdata (or similar) endpoint (REQ-07) to return recent market locations (geocoded) for the map view.
Create the GET /api/itemstats (or similar) endpoint (REQ-08, REQ-11) to calculate and return average price and price range for a specific item (nationally or filtered), implementing basic outlier filtering (REQ-12).
Phase 2: Frontend Development

Initialize Frontend Project:

Set up the frontend project using a chosen framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) or vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.
Implement basic project structure, routing (if applicable), and global styling (mobile-first approach - Section 6).
Build Submission Form Component:

Create the UI for the price submission form (REQ-02).
Fetch item and location lists from the backend (/api/items, /api/locations) to populate dropdowns dynamically.
Implement client-side validation (REQ-03).
Handle form submission: Send data to the POST /api/prices endpoint.
Display success/error messages (REQ-05).
Build List/Search View Component:

Create the UI for displaying price reports (REQ-06).
Implement filter controls (dropdowns for item, state, city).
Fetch data from GET /api/prices based on selected filters.
Display the data in a clear, responsive, sortable list or table format. Format dates and prices appropriately (â‚¦).
Build Map View Component:

Integrate Leaflet.js library (REQ-07).
Fetch market location data from GET /api/mapdata.
Display markers on the map, implementing clustering for dense areas.
Configure marker popups to show summary information upon clicking (potentially fetching detailed data for the popup on demand).
Build Basic Item Detail Component:

Create a simple UI section or page (REQ-08).
When an item is selected (e.g., from the list view), fetch statistics from GET /api/itemstats.
Display the average price and price range clearly.
Phase 3: Integration, Testing & Deployment

Connect Frontend & Backend:

Ensure all frontend components correctly communicate with the backend API endpoints.
Handle API loading states, errors, and data display consistently across the UI.
Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on the backend if frontend and backend are served from different origins.
Testing:

Perform unit tests for critical backend logic (validation, aggregation).
Perform component tests for frontend UI elements.
Conduct end-to-end testing based on the Use Cases (Section 4) to ensure features work as expected.
Test responsiveness across various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Test performance basics (load times - REQ-NonFunctional).
Deployment:

Choose hosting providers for the backend API and frontend application (e.g., Vercel, Netlify for frontend; Heroku, Render, AWS EC2/Lambda for backend; managed PostgreSQL service).
Configure environment variables for production (database credentials, API keys if any).
Set up deployment scripts or CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.
Deploy the MVP application (REQ-8).
Implement basic monitoring and logging.
Documentation:

Create a README.md file explaining the project setup, how to run it locally, and basic API usage.
